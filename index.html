    We are a group of three Berkeley High students who feel that not everyone is given equal opportunities to show their strengths
    to colleges of their choice. We have firsthand experience in field of standardized tests and feel that it is important for
    everyone to have equal chances in the admission process.

    My name is Philip Dierks and I am a junior at Berkeley High. I am a member of Berkeley High's Link Crew, a tutor and, I love to play soccer.
    I also am experienced in the process of standardized testing. Therefore, I think I am a valid member of this group. Everyone deserves to
    have an equal chance to go to college
