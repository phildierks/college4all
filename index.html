<div id="about" style="text-align: center;display:none">
    We are a group of three Berkeley High students who feel that not everyone is given equal opportunities to show their strengths
    to colleges of their choice. We have firsthand experience in field of standardized tests and feel that it is important for
    everyone to have equal chances in the admission process.

    My name is Philip Dierks and I am a junior at Berkeley High. I am a member of Berkeley High's Link Crew, a tutor and, and a varsity soccer player.
    I also am experienced in the process of standardized testing. Therefore, I think I am a valid member of this group. Everyone deserves to
    have an equal chance to go to college.

    <div id="andrew">
    I am Andrew Simpson and junior at Berkeley High School. I am a rower, and am hoping to row in college.
    Among the many obstacles in the college admissions process, standardized testing is the most daunting.
    That is why I would like to make the process more simple for students like myself.

    <div id="jacques">
    My name is Jacques Otis Xavier Ackerberg Lybarger-Martel. I'm the product of a social experiment,a junior at Berkeley High School,
    a varsity debater, an ex-soccer player, a current rugby player, and a veteran test taker. I'm lucky enough to have
    parents that can afford to buy me Barron's books and even SAT tutors, but I grew up with
    many kids who are not so fortunate. I am passionate about closing the achievement gap because it is not fair that I
    will probably do better than them on standardized tests just because I did better in the birth lottery.
