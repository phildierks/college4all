        We are a group of three Berkeley High students who feel that not everyone is given equal opportunities to show their strengths
        to colleges of their choice. We have firsthand experience in field of standardized tests and feel that it is important for
        everyone to have equal chances in the admission process.

        parents that can afford to buy me Barron's books and even SAT tutors, but I grew up with
        many kids who are not so fortunate. I am passionate about closing the achievement gap because it is not fair that I
    will probably do better than them on standardized tests just because I did better in the birth lottery.</div>
